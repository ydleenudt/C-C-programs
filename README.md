####some acknoledgements
1. ex020.c is the same as one before it. So it is negelected intentionally;
2. ex021.c lost some information so it can not be coded, thus negelected intentionally;
3. ex041.c is the same as one before it. It tests the transformation from char to its ASCII number and the use of pointer in array of char.
